# Here we provide 2 python script to visulize the specific phonon mode.

# There is a really great website to visualize the whole phonon band path

# To visualize the phonon mode one needs to create a displacements file in xyz format by reading the eigenvectors from the phonon_band.hdf5 file generate using phononpy.

# Read the xyz file using ovito and read the 3 extra displacement columns as displacement.X, displacement.Y, and displacement.Z
